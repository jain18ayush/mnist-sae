- data_name 

- make the training loop give a num for the sae to retrieve

- depth tag the sae's 
    - save them to an external drive? 

- create a get to get the activations for that sae for that dataset 

- create the training loop to generate


Goal: I have a dataset: 

(1) Load it in 
(2) visualize an image just as a check 

(3) pass that dataset in 
(4) give a depth count of the amount of sae activations to parse down == 5? 
    - train the saes on EMNIST activations 
    * just train 10 of them right now. 
(5) saves all those activations
