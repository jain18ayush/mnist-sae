- data_name 

- make the training loop give a num for the sae to retrieve

- depth tag the sae's 
    - save them to an external drive? 

- create a get to get the activations for that sae for that dataset 

- create the training loop to generate


Goal: I have a dataset: 

(1) Load it in 
(2) visualize an image just as a check 

(3) pass that dataset in 
(4) give a depth count of the amount of sae activations to parse down == 5? 
    - train the saes on EMNIST activations 
    * just train 10 of them right now. 
(5) saves all those activations 

# Utilize Detection Scoring: 
I'll expand on how you could implement detection scoring for vision model interpretations:

## Detection Scoring for Vision Models

Detection scoring is about testing whether your neuron interpretation can help predict which new images would activate that neuron. Here's a detailed approach:

### 1. Dataset Preparation
- Create a balanced test set with equal numbers of high-activating images (positive examples) and low-activating images (negative examples) for each neuron
- These should be different from the images used to generate the interpretation
- Include a diverse range of examples that span the activation distribution

### 2. Prompt Design
You could adapt the detection scoring prompt from the paper (section A.4.1) to vision:

```
You are an intelligent and meticulous computer vision researcher.

You will be given a certain neuron interpretation, such as "detects vertical lines in the top-right quadrant" or "responds to faces of elderly people with glasses".

You will then be shown several images. Your task is to determine which images would likely activate this neuron based solely on the interpretation provided.

For each image in turn, return 1 if you predict the neuron would activate on this image or 0 if you predict it would not. You must return your response in a valid Python list. Do not return anything else besides a Python list.
```

### 3. Evaluation Method
- Present the interpretations and images to the model
- Compare the model's predictions against the actual neuron activations
- Calculate metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and AUC
- You could also use a confidence threshold where the model assigns probabilities instead of binary classifications

### 4. Advanced Implementation
For more robust scoring:

1. **Stratified Sampling**:
   - Sample images from different activation quantiles (as done in the paper)
   - Test if the interpretation works across the full range of activations, not just the extremes

2. **Cross-validation**:
   - Split your image dataset into multiple folds
   - This helps ensure your scoring is not biased by particular examples

3. **Ablation Studies**:
   - Provide images with only partial information (e.g., only color information, only shape information)
   - This can help identify which aspects of your interpretation are most predictive

4. **Progressive Disclosure**:
   - Show the scoring model increasingly detailed descriptions of the images
   - This helps determine if the interpretation works at different levels of image understanding

5. **Counterfactual Testing**:
   - Create synthetic variations of images that specifically test your interpretation
   - For example, if your interpretation is "detects red circles," test with blue circles and red squares

### 5. Implementation Considerations

- The scoring model should be different from the model used to generate interpretations to avoid circular reasoning
- Consider using multimodal models that can process both images and text interpretations
- You might need to describe the images textually if your scoring model cannot directly process images
- Cache image descriptions to save computation when testing multiple interpretations

### 6. Comparison with Other Scoring Methods

As mentioned in the paper, each scoring method has strengths and weaknesses. Detection scoring is particularly good at evaluating whether your interpretation captures the appropriate contexts for activation, but it might not test whether it correctly identifies the specific features within those images.

Ideally, you would combine detection scoring with at least one other method like intervention scoring to get a more complete validation of your interpretations.

Would you like me to elaborate on any particular aspect of this detection scoring approach?
